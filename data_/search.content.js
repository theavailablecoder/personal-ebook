		"text" : "A computer is an electronic machine that can do a lot of work. It has many parts that work together. Basically, a computer has two types of parts, one which you can touch, feel and see, and the other which you can’t.  ose parts which you can see and touch are hardware.  e software makes this hardware to work. You cannot see or touch the software. In this chapter, we will study about these two parts of a computer. HARDWARE  e physical parts of a computer that you can touch or see are called hardware. Some examples of hardware are keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, scanner, microphone, etc. For example, our body consists of di erent parts. Some parts are visible from outside like hands, eyes, nose, etc. Some parts are inside our body like lungs and stomach which we cannot see. Likewise in the computer, some parts are outside, for example, keyboard, monitor, etc., while for some parts you have to open the computer system, for example, the hard disk, RAM, etc. Hardware devices can be categorised as input devices, processing devices, storage devices and output devices. Hardware Input devices Output devices Storage devices Processing devices Input Devices In our body, all our sense organs act as input devices for our body. We act depending on what we hear, see or smell. Similarly, a computer also works on the instructions provided by us. But how can we provide instructions to the computer? We can either type something using the keyboard, or we can click on the images on the screen by using the mouse. We can also use other methods like touching the screen to provide inputs (instruction) to the computer.  e hardware devices Fig. 1.1 Hardware",

Similarly, there is a computer language called Logo in which a pointer called turtle is controlled by written instructions. But in Logo, written instructions have to be given by us and not by remote.

We can use Logo to: 1. draw pictures 2. do calculations 3. print the text Starting Logo To open MS Logo, follow these steps.  Click on the Start button.  Click on Microsoft Windows Logo.
