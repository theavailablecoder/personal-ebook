		"text" : "Computer is an electronic machine that can do a lot of work. A computer has many parts that work together. Basically, a computer has two types of parts, one which you can touch, feel and see, and the other which you can’t. Those parts which you can see and touch in the computer are hardware. Th e software makes this hardware run. You cannot see or touch the software. In this chapter, we will study about these two types of parts of a computer. HARDWARE The physical parts of a computer that you can touch or see are called hardware. Some of the examples of hardware are keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, scanner, microphone, etc. For example, our body consists of different parts. Some parts are visible from outside like hands, eyes, nose, etc. Some parts are inside our body like lungs, stomach which we cannot see. Likewise in the computer, some parts are  outside, for example, keyboard, monitor, Fig. 1.1 Hardware etc. while for some parts you have to open the computer system, for example, the hard disk, RAM, etc. Hardware devices can be categorised as input devices, processing devices, storage devices and output devices. Hardware Input devices Output devices Storage devices Processing devices Input Devices In our body, all our sense organs act as input devices for our body. We act depending on what we hear, see or smell. Similarly, a computer also works on the instructions provided by us. But how can we provide instructions to the computer? We can either type something using the keyboard, or we can click on the images on the screen by using the mouse. We can also use any other method like touching the screen to provide input (instruction) to the computer. The hardware devices used to provide inputs in the form of words, pictures or sounds, etc. into a computer are called input devices. The most common input devices are keyboard and mouse. Some commonly used input devices are as follows. Joystick It helps to move the items on the screen. It is used for playing games. Mouse A mouse is a device used to point and select objects on the screen. Keyboard A keyboard is a device used to enter data into the computer. Th ere are about 101 to 105 keys on a keyboard. Webcam Microphone It is used to record our voice and other sounds into the computer. Light pen A light pen is a pointing device shaped like a pen and is used on a special pad. Whatever you write on this pad can be seen on the monitor. Computer Manners Do not press the computer keys roughly as it may damage the keyboard. Output Devices Our mouth works as an output device in our body. Likewise in computer, the devices which display, show or print the information or results are called output devices. Th e monitor is used to display the output, while the printer is used to take print-outs on paper. Speaker Printer It is used to take print-outs of text and graphics on a paper. Monitor The monitor of a computer looks like a TV screen. Whatever you type on the keyboard is seen on the monitor. Output Devices Plotter A plotter is a printer that draws high quality images on very large pieces of paper. Projector A  projector is a device that uses light and lenses to take an image and project a magnified image onto a larger screen or wall. Processing Devices When we prepare a mango shake, mango pulp, sugar and milk are added to a mixer grinder. These ingredients are the inputs. The mixer grinder grinds and then blends the ingredients. In this case, grinding and blending is processing. Mango shake is the output. Input Mango pulp, sugar and milk Process Blending in the mixer grinder Output Mango shake Fig. 1.2 Making mango shake (output) using mango pulp, sugar and milk (input) Similarly, in a computer, the central processing unit (CPU) works as a processing device. Our brain also acts as a processor in our body. The CPU takes all the decisions depending upon input, for example, our thinking is based on what we see, listen or feel. Depending upon this, our brain takes decisions for our body. As discussed previously, computer takes input in the form of numbers, pictures, etc. which are also called data. Data given to the computer is input. Data is of no use without processing. After the processing of data, computer produces output which is called information. Computer takes input from the keyboard or mouse, processes it in the CPU and shows result on the screen or monitor. This is called input-process-output (IPO) cycle. Input Process Fig. 1.3 Input-Process-Output cycle Output Let’s Know More Barcodes are black and white stripes that have the information relating to an object. For example, it may contain the name and price of a product. You can see it on a soap cover or shampoo bottle that you buy. Storage Devices Can you memorise the phone numbers of your friends and relatives? Of course not, you need a diary to note down all the phone numbers. A computer also uses storage devices to store data for future reference. Hard disk, pen drive, CD ROM, etc. are some of the storage devices used to store information in a computer. Most commonly used storage devices are as follows: It is also known as a diskette. Sometime back it was used to store and transfer data between computers. It Floppy Disk is not in use anymore. Hard disk It is the main storage device present inside the computer. It stores a large amount of data and information. Storage Devices CD CD stands for compact disc. It stores a lot of information. Pen drive It is also called flash drive. It is small and portable. It can store and transfer data from one computer to another. DVD DVD stands for digital versatile disc. DVD stores much more data than a CD. Let’s Check Name the following. 1. It is small and portable. It stores data. 2. It draws high quality images on very large pieces of paper. 3. It is used to enter data into the computer. 4.It is a device used to point and select objects on the screen.  5. It is the main storage device present inside the computer. 6. This part of the computer looks like a TV screen. SOFTWARE When you watch TV, the screen is hardware and the programme on the TV is the software. The parts of computer you can’t touch are called software. A hardware cannot do anything without a software. Software is a set of instructions written in a proper format.  There are two types of software: system software and application software. System software: The software which controls other software is called system software. Application software: The software that does a specific type of work is called application software. System Software  Your principal controls and manages all work in your school. She manages the teachers, rooms, labs, etc. in the school. Likewise a system software manages all the activities of the computer. It manages input and output operations, errors, etc. in a computer. It automatically starts running when your computer is Fig. 1.5 Operating systems turned on. Example of system software is operating system. Various operating systems are shown here. An operating system is a program that runs all the time on a computer. It interacts with us, takes input from us and shows output on the screen. It thus manages all input and output operations. Windows and android are the examples of operating system. A car has petrol, engine and wheels. But it cannot move on its own. It will move only when the driver starts it. Similarly, operating system is the driver of a computer, which makes it run. A computer cannot work in the absence of an operating system. Application Software A microwave is used to cook food; a washing machine is used for laundry purpose and a calculator is used for calculations. These devices are used for single purpose only. Similarly, in the computer, there are some software which are designed to perform a single task. These software are called application software. For example, notepad is used for writing text, paint is used to draw pictures, calculator is used to perform calculations. So paint, notepad and calculator are the examples of application software. Computer games are also an example of application software. Microsoft Word Microsoft PowerPoint Microsoft Excel  Microsoft Access Adobe Photoshop Fig. 1.6 Examples of application software Adobe Flash Let us Recall Computer Hardware Software Input Devices Output Devices Processing Devices Storage Devices System Application Buzz Words Software: a set of instructions written for a purpose IPO cycle: input, process and output cycle System soft ware: soft ware used to control other soft ware and hardware Application soft ware: soft ware used to perform a single specific task Data: raw facts and figures Information: processed data MY PRACTICE ZONE A.

		"text" : "Operating system Types of operating system Single-user Multi user Lakshay and Sophia are friends. But there is one problem, Sophia speaks and understands only English and Lakshay speaks and understands only Hindi. So, how do they communicate with each other? Tina is Lakshays friend. She understands both the languages. So, she can help them communicate. Similarly, a computer understands binary language (which contains 0 and 1 only). It is not a language that we understand. So an operating system helps us to communicate with the computer. Operating system not only helps us to communicate with the computer, but also does a lot more for us. Operating system acts as a manager who manages the computer. In this chapter, we will understand what an operating system is, what does it do and how many types of operating systems are there.Lets Know More Microsoft is a company which developed the Windows operating system. Apple Inc. is a company which developed Mac OS with a lot of versions. OPERATING SYSTEM A computer works on instructions given by us. these instructions must be given in a proper format and in a correct order. Instructions given to a computer written in a proper format and a proper sequence are called a program. An operating system is a program that runs all the time on the computer. It interacts with us, it takes input from us, and shows output on the screen. It controls hard disk, applications, mouse, printer, keyboard, etc. A computer is of no use without an operating system. Operating System Monitors activities Allocates resources Manages disks and files Fig. 2.1 Functions of an operating system Operating system CPU Monitor Mouse Printer Keyboard Fig. 2.2 Working of an operating system HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK? A computer works on the Input-Process-Output (IPO) cycle. A computer takes input from the input devices such as keyboard, mouse, scanner, etc. the CPU processes the input. The result is shown on output devices such as monitor and printer. A computer produces output on devices such as monitor and printer. from an input device, such as a keyboard, mouse, scanner, or digital camera. Data is processed in the CPU according to instructions that have been loaded into the computer’s memory. A computer uses disks, CDs, DVDs, and flash drives to permanently store data. Fig. 2.3 Working of a computer Computer Manners Sitting in front of a computer is all about right angles. Computer manners 1. Monitor position - Level with your eyes 2. Monitor distance - 18 inches away 3. Neck - Keep ear in line with your shoulder 4. Shoulders - Keep shoulders down and relaxed 5. Back - Keep against back of chair with support 6. Legs - Hip and thighs should be parallel to the ground Types of Operating Systems Various types of operating systems are available in the market. Your mobile phone also works like a computer. Operating systems are also used in mobile phones. Your mobile phone runs on an Android operating system or it may run on IOS if it is an iPhone. IOS and android are mobile operating systems. Your computer can have Windows operating system, MAC OS or it may have Linux operating system. Operating systems get updated, year after year. Each version has newer features as compared to the earlier one. they are called different versions of operating system. Various versions of Windows operating system are given below. Fig. 2.4 Some commonly used operating systems for computers Fig. 2.5 Various versions of Windows operating system After Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10 have been launched. these operating systems are specially designed for tabs and touch screen devices. the person operating the computer is called a user. An operating system may allow one or more users at a time. So, operating systems can be of two types, namely, single-user and multi-user. Single-User Operating System A single-user OS allows only one user at any point of time. these operating systems are usually used in homes. Ctrl + Esc – Opens the start menu ¬ the personal computer which you use at home is an example of a single-user system. For example, Windows XP, Mac OS (or Macintosh Operating System), Windows 7, Windows 8, etc. are single-user operating systems. Multi-User Operating System A multi-user operating system allows many users to use the same computer at the same time or at different time. A main computer is attached to many computers. Here the operating system of the main computer is used by the computer connected with the main computer. In the given gure, user 2, user 3, user 4, and user 5 are all sharing the operating system of user 1. So, the operating system of user 1 is a multi-user operating system. Examples of multi-user operating systems are UNIX, LINUX, etc. they are mainly used in railway stations, hospitals, etc. where a lot of people need to work and get information from the computers at the same time. User 1 User 2 User 3 User 6 User 5 Fig. 2.6 Working of a multi-user operating system Let’s Check Write the difference between a single-user operating system and a multiuser operating system. Single-user Operating System Multi-user Operating System Number of users allowed Can be used in Examples Let us Recall  Operating System (OS) Single-user OS (allows only one user at a time) Multi-user OS (allows many people to use the same computer at a time) Window XP, Mac OS, Window 7, Window 8 UNIX, LINUX Buzz Words Program: instruction written in proper format Operating system: a collection of program that executes all the time and makes the hardware run MY PRACTICE ZONE A.
