  answer: ["The IF-THEN-ELSE conditional statement represents a fundamental logical construct. It facilitates decision-making by evaluating a Boolean expression. If the condition evaluates to 'true,' a specified action is executed; conversely, if 'false,' an alternative action is performed. This construct enables the implementation of branching logic within algorithmic processes."],
